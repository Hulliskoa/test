		<p>This might very well be the hardest challenge of them all!

		<p>Luckily, we are here to help you. Head for the lounge and pull out a chair. In the lounge you can talk to one of the hosts in green jackets or to some of the other players. Your mission is this: 

		<p>“Try to find at least one way to use gamification-ideas and game based learning in your professional life!” When you have had your discussion, find the game-hosts and tell them about your idea! They will give you the last key-word.
